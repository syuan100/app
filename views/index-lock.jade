            | Hi I'm Krace (Grace K)! I feel absolutely honored to be a part of Jrace and Steven's wedding. It's been an incredible blessing to be planning our weddings together this year and doing this long-distance thing has enabled us to grow even closer, which is crazy and beautiful, just like us (I'm crazy, she's beautiful)! I'm currently teaching Kindergarten in San Diego, which makes me slightly nervous about making a toast at this wedding considering my audience generally consists of 5-year olds who will laugh or cry at anything. Hope I don't screw it up too much. Love you, bestie.
            br
            br
            | Jrace and I met freshman year at ucsd, and and I don't think she liked me much back then because I was super loud and obnoxious. I have since toned it down a little bit, and I think she likes me a little more now. One fun memory I have of us is baking cookies on Valentines' Day, while I was going through a bad breakup. Grace was kind of like, SCREW BOYS! FORGET THEM! LET'S MAKE COOKIES! and we made these heart cut-out, super romantic cute cookies, put them in little cute bags, and then proceeded to pass them out to boys. LOL. and other friends. She cared for me, even when I was a total downer and was mopey for way too long. 
            br
            br
            | I am SO excited and feel really honored to be in this bridal party because I can't imagine what the past 7 years would have been like without Grace. She's like the sister I never had, and even though she has 3 amazing sisters of her own she still loved me a lot! I'm really looking forward to hanging out with everyone, getting all made up together, and trying to hold back my tears (so as not to ruin said make-up) when she and Steven say "I do" in front of all of their friends, family, and God. I feel emotional already! That's enough!
            br
            br
            | If I were to be stranded on an island (by choice or otherwise), I would bring a magic genie who is willing to grant my wishes, a really smart and preferably handsome companion (husband, I guess), and a fully stocked boat in case the first two fall through and I need to take care of business on my own. :)

            | Hello! My name is Ann. I'm the second Jiras sister and since 1992, Grace has always been the best role model and friend I could ever ask for. She was there to celebrate with me, encourage me, and give me real talk whenever I needed it but didn't want to hear it. 
            br
            br
            | Growing up, I liked copying Grace in everything she did. Our mom even started giving us the same presents on our birthdays and at Christmas, to Grace's dislike and my utter joy. Grace was cool, so whatever she got was cool, and I wanted to be cool too. We had matching clothes, bikes, Lisa Frank stationary and art sets... my dream come true! It's crazy to realize how much time has passed and how much we've changed since then! Even though now we find ourselves in different careers (she's in technical recruiting and I'm a structural engineer), cities (SF vs. LA), and life stages (she's going to be MRS. GRACE YUAN!!!), her impact and presence in my life is the same as it was when we were growing up. 
            br
            br
            | To Grace: thanks for putting up with me (like the time I was 6 and poked your eye), loving me, teaching me (how to draw Keroppi and Hello Kitty, how to use HTML and FTP, how to love our younger sisters...), and encouraging me (like that time when I was at UCLA and you drove all the way from SD to study with me in Kerchkhoff on a Saturday evening because I was stressed out), and being my confidante. I still can't believe you're getting married!!
            br
            br
            | To Steven: I am so happy that my sister has found someone to share her life with and that that person is you! You are a fun and caring guy with a big heart, and you know how to make Grace happy! I am honored to welcome you into the Jiras clan ;) 
            br
            br
            | I am so excited as Grace and Steven embark on this new phase in their lives together. I know that their marriage will be a testimony of God's faithfulness and love!

            | Hi I am Becky! I am currently a sophomore at UC Berkeley, majoring in Media studies! I am Grace's baby baby baby sister hehe :)  and I have known her for my entire life! I can recall lots of memories of Grace being my play school teacher, and her teaching me how to write my own name and incentivizing me with lots of stickers lol. I also remember that when I wasn't feeling well, she would give me "medicine" which was apple juice in a medicine cup and a flinstone vitamin. Another fun memory would be the time I got to stay in Grace's apartment in SD when I was just a little freshmen in highschool and Grace introduced me to my love of frozen yogurt. Another fun memory was when I was little, Grace's bedroom was right across from mine, and when I couldn't sleep I would wake her up and ask to crawl into bed with her (: Most of the times she would let me in haha 
            br
            br
            | I AM MOST EXCITED BY THE FACT THAT MY BIGGEST SISTER IS GETTING MARRIED!!!!!! such excite.  Although I have three older sisters, Grace will always be my BIGGEST sister and she has a special place in my heart. She has been the best sister I could ever ask for, always knowing just what to do and say, and lending me wise big sis advice. I am so incredibly excited for Grace and what this next chapter of her life has in store for her, and I am honored that I made the cut to be a bridesmaid and be a part of her special day!

            | Hi my name is Joanie and I am exactly a month younger than Grace. I am a public relations specialist at a major video game company in San Francisco. I am always thinking about food. Which is 50% why I got so into running these last couple of years, finishing my first full marathon last summer. I make a mean bread pudding and and other baking goodness. I've been known to trip walking UP the stairs, trip while crossing the street and a perpetual victim of the "jump-scare" (especially if my younger sister is home.)  
            br
            br
            | I've known Grace since I was born so I've got a plethora of memories. My favorite memories were when we played together at our aunt's house and we pretended to be mermaids, complete with "mermaid hair."  Jumping into her pool and making "Joanie vs. Wild" videos during summer breaks and being each other's senior prom dates. 
            br
            br
            | If I were stuck on a deserted island, I'd bring a flint stick, an all-purpose knife, and my Bible. The first two chosen for my survival (and because I watch survivalist shows with my dad) and the last for my sanity and soul.

            | How I know the groom and/or bride: I first met Steven when we were both in 8th Grade at a church camping retreat! After that, we really started to become close friends when we were roommates at UCSD during 3rd year, at the infamous 3121 apartment at Costa Verde. The years that followed were enthralling, terrifying, wonderful, enriching, and profound. We grew as brothers and crew, and are looking forward to a long lifetime of brotherhood. Grace was also a good friend of our group, and we got to know each other through our time at UCSD, but mostly I know her through all the great things Steven said about her! 
            br
            br
            | A shared memory between me and Steven: A few years after we graduated from college, I was burned out from work. I was desperate to get away, return to the source, and see nature again. I decided to spontaneously go camping in Sequoia. When I told all my friends, Steven was the only one who was down to drop everything go. We brought a bottle of Speyside single malt Scotch, some steaks, fishing gear, and a six pack of beers and had a great weekend cooking by the fire, hiking, and fishing. We then drove back to our busy civilized life while blasting 90's gangster rap the whole way back.

            | Steven and I were roommates during our first year at UCSD. The first time I met Steven was when I strolled into our shared dorm room 10 minutes before the housing registration cut-off. I'm not sure what he thought of me then, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't a great first impression.
            br
            br
            | As the school year progressed though, we started learning more and more about each other and realized that we shared a lot of passions and interests, and it was during this time that I knew Steven was someone that I wanted to keep in my life. We lived together for another four years after that, up until he moved up to San Francisco to pursue his dream in whatever he's doing right now.
            br
            br
            | There was this one time Steven and I were playing with alcohol stoves, basically just reconstructed soda cans that use isopropanol vapor as fuel. Anyway, long story short, I accidentally spilled a bunch of rubbing alcohol all over my basketball shorts, and Steven, in a moment of pure brilliance, decided that the best way to get rid of the alcohol would be to burn it off. I didn't stop him. The moment that alcohol ignited, we realized pretty quickly that the only brilliant thing in the room was the flame that was now engulfing my legs. I lost my basketball shorts that day, got a huge burn on both my thighs, and overloaded my body with adrenaline. You know, just your average Tuesday night with the wonderful Steven Yuan.

            | It was February 14, eight years ago. We were freshmen at UCSD and attended the same calculus class. In my dorm room, Steven was on the floor solving problems while I was on my bed reviewing concepts for our upcoming exam. I asked, “Steven, do you know how to solve sin2x + cos2x?” He replied, “I do.” As soon as I heard that reply, I knew those two words held a special meaning in my heart and I held onto it very dearly. Steven was the one. 
            br
            br
            | Fasting forward to June 27 of this year. I was in medical school in LA, while Steven was working in San Francisco. I flew up to see him for a special occasion. As we stood next to each other, I felt reassured by his calm and confident presence. Steven was holding the ring. My heart was beating fast. He was ready. I was ready. When he got down on his knees and said, “Will you marry me?” I knew in my heart what the answer was.

            | Steven was one of my first friends in college, and I had met him through Grace, who I'm pretty sure had a crush on him at the time.
            br
            br
            | One memory of Steven that I’ll never forget is when he recruited me to help him sell chicken bowls to fund a missions trip to Korea.
            br
            br
            | He had to raise about a thousand dollars for his ticket, and I remember one night, when I was trying to figure out whether the idea was even viable (it wasn’t looking too strong on paper), Steven busted through the our apartment door with his arms full of boxes. He had gone out and bought two gigantic rice warmers, 3 boxes of 100 count disposable chopsticks, restaurant style to-go containers, and a ton of chicken.
            br
            br
            | Needless to say, we were committed.
            br
            br
            | We pull an all-nighter cooking chicken (our secret ingredient was aloe juice) and making rice. The next morning we lug everything onto campus and set up in the quad next to our dorm. I always cringe a little when I think about how questionable we looked – two guys sitting next to the laundry room, asking confused passerbys if they wanted to buy a chicken bowl. We decided to call it a day once we started noticing people taking the long way around.
            br
            br
            | At the end of the day, we had sold 0 chicken bowls, and Steven was now a couple hundred dollars in the red.
            br
            br
            | We also had to eat chicken for the next two weeks.
            br
            br
            | So there were two things I learned from this experience: the first was that doing a little thinking goes a long way in business (ahem, Steven).
            br
            br
            | The second was that Steven was the kind of person who is willing to take the chance, invest, and work hard for something he believes in.
            br
            br            
            | If you read this Grace, I’d like to let you know that whenever Steven talks about you, I can tell that he truly believes in you, and I know that he will work hard to be the best husband he can be. The only thing I’d ask of you, is to help him out with that little bit of thinking he sometimes forgets to do. Just kidding Steven! (not really)

            | I was walking around UCSD during freshman year orientation week and I remember seeing a group of people sitting at a table intently watching someone who looked like he was performing a card magic trick. I was impressed with how captivated they looked, so I decided to go say hi and see what's up. Little did I know, this group of people would later become some of my best friends throughout college. Among this group was Grace (the bride), who later brought Steven (whom she met during orientation) to one of the hangouts, and that was how I met them both. Steven and I were both actively involved in Intervarsity Christian Fellowship. During the times of being in the same small groups to serving and praying together, we had many conversations on spirituality, ministry, and life in general; through that, I was able to see how much God has done in his life and how much he has grown as an individual. I am thankful for good times and memories we have shared throughout undergrad. From skateboarding around campus to snowboarding down the mountains, from numerous surprise birthdays to spontaneous night trips to the beach, Steven has been one of my best friends during college and will be for the years to come.
